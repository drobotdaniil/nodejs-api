For the hometask you need to create an application where user can
login using any social network or SSO service you want (Google, Facebook,
Github, etc). Use passport.js for this.
After login display logged in user info and provide ability to log out. 
Don't care a lot about HTML styling, keep it simple.
You can use any template engine you want.
